<p> 
John Evans Atta Mills, (born July 21, 1944, Tarkwa, Ghana‚Äîdied July 24, 2012, Accra, Ghana), Ghanaian politician and scholar who served as president of Ghana (2009‚Äì12).

After secondary school, Mills studied law at the University of Ghana (LL.B., 1967), the London School of Economics and Political Science (LL.M., 1968), and the University of London‚Äôs School of Oriental and African Studies, completing his Ph.D. dissertation (1971) on taxation and economic development. 
On his return to Ghana, he taught law at the University of Ghana, where he remained for some 25 years. 
He also served on numerous boards and committees, occasionally acted as a visiting professor in the United States and the Netherlands, and published extensively on taxation, including the Report of the Tax Review Commission, Ghana (1977).

Mills eventually left academia to establish a distinguished career in public service. 
Appointed in 1988 as acting commissioner of Ghana‚Äôs Internal Revenue Service, he eventually became (1993) substantive commissioner. 
He stood as Pres. Jerry Rawlings‚Äôs running mate under the banner of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the 1996 elections. 
They were victorious, and Mills took office on January 7, 1997, as vice president, a post he held until 2001. 
Mills was the NDC candidate for the presidency in the 2000 and 2004 elections, but he was defeated by John Kofi Agyekum Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). </p>

<p> During his first two presidential campaigns, Mills had been roundly criticized for statements that if elected he would consult with Rawlings. 
When Mills was again the NDC candidate for the presidency in 2008, he distanced himself from his former mentor and campaigned on the slogan ‚ÄúI believe in Ghana.‚Äù 
Self-described as a social democrat who believed in the concept of social welfare espoused by Kwame Nkrumah (independent Ghana‚Äôs first leader), Mills embraced a political platform that was more comprehensive and less divisive than that of either Nkrumah or Rawlings. 
Mills‚Äôs persistence and determination paid off when he won the 2008 presidential poll, defeating the NPP‚Äôs candidate, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, by a narrow margin (50.23‚Äì49.77 percent). 
The election marked the second time in Ghana‚Äôs history that one legitimately elected leader had handed over power to another. 
It demonstrated that, after an era of coups and dictatorship (1966‚Äì92), democracy had been established and reinforced in the western African country, despite occasional eruptions of ethnic conflict and political tension. </p>

After his inauguration he set about to improve the socioeconomic situation of ordinary Ghanaians, who ranked among the world‚Äôs poorest people, with an average daily income of $2.32, a 60 percent literacy rate, and 10 percent unemployment despite the country‚Äôs potentially valuable natural resources. In his first State of the Nation address on February 19, 2009, Mills announced an austerity program, promising steep cuts in government spending, beginning with cutbacks in wages and a review of the government‚Äôs recent order of two presidential jets. He also instituted policies to eliminate four cabinet ministries and reduced the size of the presidential convoy. Mills presided over the commencement of the country‚Äôs first commercial oil production in late 2010 and promised that government would spend the newfound oil revenue responsibly.

In July 2011 the NDC selected Mills to be the party‚Äôs candidate in the 2012 presidential elections; however, he died five months before the elections were to be held.
He was married to Ernestina Naadu Mills, an educationist, and has a son, Sam Kofi Atta Mills. </p>
